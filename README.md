# What Affects How Long a Recipe Takes to Complete?
By Shweta Kumar  

## Introduction

The dataset used for this analysis is the **Recipes and Ratings Dataset**, sourced from **food.com**. It consists of two key files:
- **`RAW_recipes.csv`**: Contains recipe details like name, tags, preparation time, ingredients, and nutritional values.
- **`RAW_interactions.csv`**: Contains user reviews and ratings for recipes.

This dataset is significant because it offers insights into recipe preparation time, ingredient complexity, and user preferences, making it valuable for food enthusiasts, recipe developers, and even restaurants looking to optimize their menus.

### Question of Focus
**"What factors affect how long a recipe takes to complete?"**

Understanding the factors that affect recipe preparation time helps home cooks plan meals more efficiently and avoid overly complex recipes. For recipe developers and businesses, these insights enable the creation of time-friendly content that appeals to busy individuals, boosting user satisfaction and engagement. Ultimately, this analysis benefits anyone looking to optimize their cooking experience or tailor recipes to specific audience needs.

Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli.  I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified.  Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect.

### Cleaning Steps:
1. Converted `rating = 0` to `NaN` to avoid skewing averages.
2. Dropped irrelevant columns like `steps`, `description`, and `review`.
3. Dropped rows with missing values in `avg_rating`.
4. Extracted numeric features from the `nutrition` column and renamed them for clarity (`calories`, `protein`, etc.).

### Filtered Tags:
To simplify the analysis, I limited the `tags` column to four categories:
- **'15-minutes-or-less', '30-minutes-or-less', '60-minutes-or-less', '4-hours-or-less'**
